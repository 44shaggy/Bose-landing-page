This project showcases a responsive landing page built with HTML, CSS (SCSS,  BEM), and JavaScript. It is optimized for multi-device viewing and cross-browser compatibility.

The design focuses on user experience, featuring a clean, intuitive layout and responsive elements that adapt seamlessly to any screen size. Key sections include a hero area, features overview, pricing details, and a clear call-to-action, effectively presenting the product or service.

This project highlights my skills in modern web technologies and best practices for creating functional and visually appealing designs.
